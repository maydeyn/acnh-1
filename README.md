## Tool durability <sub><sup><sub>[`source`](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/31/21194209/durability-list-broken-breaking-shovel-axe-fishing-rod-watering-can-slingshot-bug-net)</sub></sup></sub>

Tools only wear down when your action is successful. Ladders, Vaulting Poles, and Wands will not break. Watering empty land decreases a Watering Can’s durability by 10% of its use on flower(s).
